# Pythagorean Pennants
## The flag on your wall as a kid now telling your teams future

The Pythagorean Expectation or Projection is way of measuring your team's actual performance. It essentially says that a team's point differential is a better predictor of future performance than their actual record. It was developed by the great Bill James[1] and adapted for basketball by Daryl Morely[2] and shown for football on the FootballOutsiders[3] website.

I took the numbers and put a visual twist on them, see your favorite team colors - like on your wall as a kid - and quickly see which way your team could be headed in the upcoming season.
